## Contribute
This is my first Opensource repo I plan to go into production, and I would LOVE the community to contribute. So if you have any feature ideas, want to fix a big, or just want to help polish up the code before release, PRs and issues are always welcome!

Want to add a new question and ELO rating? Convention goes:
```
        rating: parseFloat(parts[0]),
        id: parseInt(parts[1]),
        title: parts[2],
        titleSlug: parts[4],
        completed: false
```
